# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The aim of project is to use the user provided parameters to detect the probability of having heart disease using a dataset and machine learning techniques for the prediction.

Dataset Used:
The dataset for this project is taken from a study conducted at Cleveland, Hungary,
Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach.

 Predicts the disease with the given parameters.
 Compare the given parameters with the input datasets.
 Display the list of features where user can input parameters.
 Classification algorithm is used to classify the data sets.
